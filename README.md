# ImageDecryption
CS240 Spring 2022 Lab #5 tasked me to decrypt a specific image where we had to code for the threshold, transformation then finally the cryptography in order to see the final product of the image. The original image was blurred out and was not in the correct dimension so with this lab I had to essentially "uncover" the image.
